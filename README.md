# IIT-Assignment-1_Rangga-Sugandi
University of Canberra - Introduction to Information Technology (4478/9836)
Student : Rangga Sugandi


Overview:
This repository contains my submissions required for Assignment 1 of IIT, focusing on the logic behind designing a low-cost automated pet feeder system. 
The solution follows the Integrated Problem-Solving Process and includes analysis, flowchart, word-based coding, and testing.

In this repo, I have submitted the necessities for Part 1, aswell as Part 2 (well this whole github is Part 2)


Structure:
Step1_Analysis        : Defines the problems, assumptions, as well as the block diagram
Step2_Data Description: Organized and described data as well as a table consisting of the variables.
Step3_Logic           : Includes the logic of the system aswell as a visual flowchart to help illustrate
Step4_WordCode        : A simple string of logic written in pseudo-code and made as similar as possible to python
Step5_Testing         : Sample scenarios and refinements


Additional Notes:
- All required files are included and orgainzed per the assignment instructions
- The Flowchart and Block Diagram were created using draw.io and exported as PNG's
- GitHub Repo is public and I have invited the collaborators as per Instruction
