Testing and Refining The Solution

Scenario 1 - Pet eats as expected
- At 09:00 the feeder checks and sees there’s 80% of food in the bin. Hatch is opened, motor runs, and food is dispensed.
- After 15 minutes, the bowl weight drops by more than half so the system assumes the pet ate.
- Refinement: Works exactly as intended, no refinement necessary.

Scenario 2 - Pet does not eat
- Food is dispensed normally, but the system notices the bowl hasn’t changed weight over 50% in 15 minutes.
- System sends an alert saying the food hasn’t been eaten and shuts down until restarted.
- Refinement: Good but maybe the alert should suggest pets may need medical attention.

Scenario 3 - Food bin is empty
- At feeding time, the food level in the bin is only 4%.
- The feeder does not dispense, alerts staff that food is empty, and ceases operations.
- Refinement: Could improve by repeating the alert periodically until resolved.

Scenario 4 - Hatch jammed
- Food level is sufficient, but the hatch sensor shows it won’t open.
- The motor attempts to run but hatch is stuck, so an alert is sent and the system shuts down.
- Refinement: System could retry opening hatch before fully shutting down.

Scenario 5 - Low food warning
- At feeding time, the food capacity is 15%.
- System dispenses food but sends a warning to staff to refill the feeder.
- Refinement: Works as intended, no refinements needed.

Scenario 6 - Sensor error
- Food capacity sensor fails to return a value, leading to misreads (defaulting to 0 or stale value).
- Refinement: System should explicitly alert staff if a sensor itself fails.
